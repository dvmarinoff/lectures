/*Unix history*/
-OS developed at Bell Labs(1969-1971)
-Rewritten in C, so it can be portable(originaly in assembly)
-C is made specifically for making portable programs for Unix
-Unix spreads outside AT&T(1975) after anti-trust case.
-Branches and improvments(1977-present)
	-Open source: BSD, Linux
	-Closed source: Solaris, AIX, HP/UX
	-Mixed source: Mac OS X
"Unix" now means a "Unix-like system"
-Mobile devices are Unix -
	-iOS, Android

-Mac OS X:
	-BSD Unix + NeXTSTEP + Apple code = Darwin
Darwin is the the "under the hood" Unix of OS X
Access Unix directly fromthe command line using Terminal

-Differenc in power and control 

//Terminal application
echo 'Hello World'

UpArrow and DownArrow to go through previous commands	
Ctrl + a - moves cursor to start of line
Ctrl + e - moves cursor to end of line
Tab - autocomplete
Tab + Tab - show list of possible matches
Alt + ~ - Cycle between Terminal windows

//Command structure
command	options	argument 

options and arguments are optional
options could be a List:
ls -l -a -h Desktop
ls -lah Desktop	- short for the latter
options sometimes have argumenton their own:
banner -w 50 'Hello World!'
width: 50

//Kernel and shells
-kernel - core of the OS
	- allocates time and memory to programs
	- OS X uses Mach kernel
-shell  - Outer layer of OS
	- interacts with user
	- sends requests to kernel

Shells:
- sh - Thompson Shell(1971)
- sh - Bourne Shell(1977)
- csh - C Shell(1979)
- tcsh - Tabbed C Shell(1979)
- ksh - Korn Shell(1982)
- bash - Bourne-Again Shell(1987)
- zsh - Z Shell(1990)

Moving around shells:
echo $Shell	- show default shell
echo $0		- show current shell
sh		- to bourne shell
bash		- to bash shell 
exit		- exit current shell

Shell can nest.

//Unix manual pages
man + what you want to look up in the manual
f	- forward
Space	- forward
b	- backwards
q	- quit

man -k banner	- show what banner does

/*File system basics*/
//working directory - the dirctory where we are now, where commands are issuied

pwd	- present working directory
/	- root 
-listing files and directories -
ls	- list directories
ls -l	- list directories vertical
ls -la	- list all directories and files
ls -lah - returns sixe in human readable format

.	- reference to current directory
..	- reference to parent directory
.files	- configuration files

-	- file
d	- directory
l	- link

//moving around the filesystem 
cd + path to directory	 
cd ..		- go to parent directory
cd ../..	- go back two levels
cd ~		- to home directory
cd -		- last directory
/		- represent absolute path, root
Ctrl + a	- beginning of line
Ctrl + e	- end of line

/Users/Someone	- absolute path
Users/Someone	- relative path

//file system organization 
/	- Root
/bin	- Binaries, programs
/sbin	- System binaries, system programs
/dev 	- Devices: hard drive, keyboard, mouse, etc.
/etc	- System configurations
/home 	- User home directories
/lib	- Libraries of code
/tmp	- Temporary files
/var	- Various, mostly files system uses
/usr	- User programs, tools and libraries (not files)
/usr/bin
/usr/etc
/usr/lib
/usr/local

/*Working with files and directories*/
//naming files
- avoid /\*&%$|^~<> and most other symbols
- use A-Z, a-z, 0-9, period, underscore, hyphen(do not start withthis one)
- stick with lowercase
- escape spaces with \ or " "
- file endings

//creating files
- touch	- updates file access if it exists else creates it
- use text editor

//UNIX text editors
ed - earlier
vi - visual editing mode
vim - vi improved
GNU Emacs - Macros to automate work
pico - 
nano - basic features, easy to use

//reading files
cat	- concatenate
more	- paginated output, can not go backwards
less	- backward scrolling, better memory use
g	- go to the top of the document
G	- go to the end of the document
which	- return path to file

head	- display lines from beginning of a file
tail	- display lines from end of a file
tail -f	- 'follow' the tail of a file

tail -f /var/log/system_log
tail -f /varlog/apache2/access_log

//creating directoies
mkdir testdir

mkdir testdir/test1	- will work if testdir exist
mkdir -p testdir/test1/test2	- parent option for creating multuple directories
-v	- verbose, return feedback
-vp

//moving and renaming files and directories
mv newtextfile.txt testdir/newfile.txt	- moving
mv newfile.txt testdir/new_file.txt	- also for renaming
 
options:
-n	- no overwriting
-f	- force overwriting
-i	- interactive overwriting, 'ask me'
-v	- verbose

//coping
cp new_file.txt newer_file.txt

options:
-R	- recursive copy

//deleting
rm somefile.text 	- removes it permanantly, does not sends it first to the trash
rmdir folder		- removes non-empthy dirs
rm -r /path/		- removes dirs

//hard links 
ln  filetolink hardlink name/pathtofile 	- reference to the file, that do not break,
											 if file is moved or deleted

//symbolic links - 'sym link'
ln -s filetolink symlink	- reference a file or a directory path,
						  	 break when file is moved

//searching 
find path expression
find ~/Documents -name "someimage.jpg"

	- wildcard characters
????	- any one character
*		- zero or more characters (glob)
[] 		- any character in the brackets

"index.????"
"index.*"
"*.html"
"index[123].html"
"file?[123].html"

-and -not -path *Preferences* 	- excludes from search
